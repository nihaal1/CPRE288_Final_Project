Project Group 1: Cybot Valet Service
Group Members: Dana Boor, Varun Advani, Nihaal Zaheer, Kalyan Thapaliya

Test Field:




Test Field Summary: 
The test field illustrates a parking lot for Cybots. The parking lot has 4 parking spaces, a designated entry and exit, and a single marked path that Cybots will follow. Each parking space would have a tape marker in front of it to indicate a parking space, and the Cybot would use object detection software and the ping/IR sensors to find an empty parking space. The single marked path will have tall objects that the Cybot will detect with the ping and IR sensors and sound a horn until the object is moved. Small objects will also be present and will be detected using the Cybot’s bump sensors. On bumping a small object, a horn is sounded and a parking attendant will be notified to press button 4 on the Cybot, for resuming motion. A user interface will be used to communicate a recall feature, that will return the cybot to the exit of the parking lot. The Cybot will use the single marked path  to make the necessary turns. 


Problem Statement:
Problem: Vehicle owners need an alternative to manual valet services to park their vehicles.
Application Narrative:
           Businesses have attempted to alleviate the stress of vehicle parking by offering valet services. While it is convenient to have another human park your car, it is not without various disadvantages. Consumers have reported that they are distrustful of the valets that park their vehicles and are worried that their vehicles will be driven carelessly and potentially damaged. Consumers are also concerned that their valuable belongings are not safe being left in their car when a valet is driving, forcing the consumer to take their valuables with them instead of leaving them in their car [5]. Additionally, valets often expect a tip for parking your vehicle, placing an added cost on the consumer.
          The users for our application would be vehicle owners that park their vehicle in the parking lot of restaurants, shopping malls, office complexes, banks, and small businesses, who may find it inconvenient to look for a parking spot and who are not comfortable with a valet driving their car. It is also for vehicle owners who are concerned with personal safety and property damage when utilizing a valet service to park their vehicle. 
          To address these concerns, our team proposes an automated valet service. This will allow the consumer to simply drive to the entrance of a parking lot, exit the vehicle, and command the vehicle to locate a vacant parking spot and park autonomously. The automated valet service will also support the ability to recall the vehicle to the exit of the parking lot remotely, by the press of a button. The automated valet service will utilize infrared (IR) and ping sensor technology to detect surrounding objects and prevent collisions. In the event that an object is below the range of detection for these sensors, bump sensors will detect the object and stop the vehicle from continuing to drive forward. 








Research Summary:
	Valet parking is an integral part of vehicle ownership in the United States. On average, 67 percent of car owners report using valet parking services. In urban areas, this number grows to 75 percent [2]. Because of this, our team has chosen to focus primarily on the needs of vehicle owners and incorporate those needs into the design of our autonomous valet parking system. Our team’s research focused on two types of users: 1) vehicle owners concerned with personal safety, property damage, and theft, and 2) vehicle owners interested in the convenience of valet parking. 
	For vehicle owners concerned with personal safety, property damage, and theft we were interested to find out that several vehicle owners have reported violent crimes committed against them in parking areas [7]. Parking areas are the third most likely place for violent crimes to occur [8]. To combat this, many vehicle owners prefer to have their vehicle parked by a valet service. However, vehicle owners have also reported that they are concerned that their vehicles will be damaged by the valet service drivers or that their personal belongings may be stolen by the drivers [4]. Our autonomous parking system will provide the perfect solution to these concerns. By having vehicles safely park and retrieve themselves, vehicle owners can still enjoy the benefits of valet parking without having to worry about the concerns listed above.
Our research into vehicle owners interested in the convenience of valet parking yielded very interesting information. Vehicle owners believe that valet parking saves time and is worth the cost of paying for the service [4]. The main motivation that we found for utilizing valet parking is that many vehicle owners find it frustrating trying to navigate unfamiliar parking areas, and that many find it difficult to locate their vehicle once they are ready to leave a parking area [5]. Moreover, Vehicle owners are impressed how well autonomous vehicles can park themselves and are trusting in the autonomous parking technology [1] and are interested in being able to remotely recall their vehicles out of a parking area [3]. Our autonomous valet parking system will offer this group of users the ability to enjoy the convenience of valet parking and the ability to park and retrieve their vehicles independent of human-operated valet services.
